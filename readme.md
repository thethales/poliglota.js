# Poliglota.js

Ligthweight client side processing JS library designed to facilitate the generation of 
variable content to multi language webpages.

## Getting Started


These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
To get a running example, just download the entire directory contents and execute [example.html](https://github.com/thethales/poliglota.js/blob/master/example.html)

Note: The project is still on its infacy, therefore perfomance issues might be a thing.

### Prerequisites

Note: The browser must have Javascript Support

A JSON file containing the proper sentences in the desired languages must be created following the sample file [data.json](https://github.com/thethales/poliglota.js/blob/master/data.json)  (Documentend [here](https://github.com/thethales/poliglota.js/blob/master/data.schema.json))  or according to the structure below 

```
{
    "pt-br": {
        "1": "Ol√°",
        "2": "Seja Bem Vindo"
    },
    "en-us": {
        "1": "Hello",
        "2": "Welcome"
    }
}
```


### Installing

Download the contents of the folder *src* and place them inside your project JS library folder

Make the reference to the javascrit file in your HTML page

```
<script src='poliglota.js'></script>
```



With the data JSON file in mind, create or adapt the HTML page with the addition of the reserverd data attribute at the desired places for sentence substituion

```
<div data-poli>
</div>
```

Call the constructor, setting the parameters of language and the JSON file containing the dataset

```
<script>
    //The first parameter corresponds to the requested language
    //The second paramenter corresponds to the JSON data, be it a file URL or a JSON object
    poliglota.init('en-us', '\data.json');
</script>
```
